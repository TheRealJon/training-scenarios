# Interactive Katacoda Scenarios

Thanks for contributing to PatternFly Developer Training! Listed below are steps to follow when adding a training scenario.

### Writing Scenarios
Visit https://www.katacoda.com/docs to learn more about creating Katacoda scenarios
For examples, visit https://github.com/katacoda/scenario-example

We have put together a [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pHckYqqrXtozpW8Bjj1DLaeN0Ghi4zC7Ds4DS3KRdek/edit?usp=sharing) to use when putting together a scenario, feel free to Make a Copy of this document.

**Consistent structure for step instructions**
Having a consistent structure will help users skim the contents to find the chunks of info they're looking for without having to read more than they want to. 

## Step title, written as imperative that describes at a high level the theme for this step (e.g. overriding variables)

Statement that sets context for this step, possibly referencing the previous step, but also describes more explicitly the tasks the user will complete in the context of the scenario (e.g. define a variable to use in a card).

1) <strong>Imperative statement about this sub-task.</strong> Additional statements if needed to explain why this sub-task is important.

Imperative statement that explicitly describes how to complete this task.

Then, another imperative statement, as needed to complete this task.

<strong>Hint:</strong> A hint that shows exactly what change the user should see in their workspace.

<strong>Note:</strong> Include a note for a sub-task if it's possible that a user could be confused about something. This is a place to include additional explanation about a concept that would be too much to include with the sub-task description.

## Scenario Feedback
In the `finish.md` file add a link to our qualtrics survey so that feedback can be recorded. Use this link: https://redhatdg.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bIRZRHYJyGsKBSt?Module= and at the end of `Module=` add the title of the scenario so that we can target feedback.
