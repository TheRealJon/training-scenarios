# Modify Simple Component

Components have multiple variations due in part to the use of modifier classes, which override or add new styling to the same component. Modifiers use the “pf-m-” prefix, followed by a suitable name for the modifier. Patternfly aims to use consistent names for modifiers across components, however the styles for each modifier are specific to that component element.

## Task: Modify modifier classes to the badge component
a. Let’s start modifying the modifier class for a simple component, the badge.
Note: the badge is a component that requires a modifier.

b. Copy code to the editor

c. You should see two badges appear with the background-color of blue. The modifier class: `pf-m-unread` modifies its styles to be “unread”

d .The badge also has a “read” state. Your task is to update the second badge so that it has the modifier for “read”. What did the background color change to?
